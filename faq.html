				<button class="accordion">What is the Mythic Challenge?</button>
				<div class="panel">
							<p class="panelText">The Destiny 2 Mythic Challenge is the most hardcore way to play Destiny 2. In addition to the base game's rules, there are a few added restrictions to the way you are allowed to play. These restrictions make the game much more difficult, and are meant to test the gameplay capabilities of well versed and experienced players.</p>
							<p class="panelText">The goal of this challenge is to take a brand new Destiny 2 account all the way to Guardian Rank 11 - playing solo as much as possible. This means there is an artificial "seasonal" timer on how long you have to achieve Rank 11 before your progress is reset.</p>

				<button class="accordion">Why is Guardian Rank 11 the end goal?</button>
				<div class="panel">
							<p class="panelText">While you may have your own opinions on the Guardian Rank system as a whole, it does provide a nice checklist of activities that scale in difficulty to work my way through. And most importantly, it forces me to play all of the most difficult endgame activities with the added restrictions I put in place.</p>
							<p class="panelText">It's also a timed objective, since every season your Guardian Rank resets back to Rank 5. This means that not only do I have to complete the most difficult activities in the game, but I have to do them in a certain time period.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">Why am I doing this?</button>
				<div class="panel">
							<p class="panelText">I like hard games, I like increasingly more difficult challenges, and I wanted to make this game the hardest version of itself I could.</p>
							<p class="panelText">Every accomplishment - every loot drop feels much more exciting to achieve this way when you could lose it all at a moment's notice.</p>
