				<button class="accordion">What is the Mythic Challenge?</button>
				<div class="panel">
						<p class="panelText">The Destiny 2 Mythic Challenge is the most hardcore way to play Destiny 2. In addition to the base game's rules, there are a few added restrictions to the way you are allowed to play.</p>
						<p class="panelText">The goal of this challenge is to take a brand new Destiny 2 account all the way to Guardian Rank 11 - playing solo as much as possible.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">What are the specific rules?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<dl class="panelText">
						<dt class="listTitle">Permadeath</dt>
						<dd>If the active Guardian is downed at any point, they must immediately return to character selection and delete that character, along with all gear on that character.</dd>
						<br>
						<dd>The nature of the death does not impact the result - whether it's PVE, PVP, or a Social Space, every death counts.</dd>
						<br>
						<dd>EXCEPTIONS</dd>
						<dd>- Being calcified by The Witness during the Salvation's Edge Verity encounter is not considered a death.</dd>
						<dd>- Loading into an activity in a "downed" state is not considered a death.</dd>
						<br>
						<dt class="listTitle">No HUD</dt>
						<dd>The HUD is never allowed to be enabled at any point during play.</dd>
						<br>
						<dt class="listTitle">No Vault</dt>
						<dd>Guardians are not allowed to use the vault in any manner. If any item is sent to the vault - be it intentional or automatic - it must be dismantled and cannot be added to a Guardian's inventory.</dd>
						<br>
						<dt class="listTitle">No Postmaster</dt>
						<dd>Guardians are not allowed to use the postmaster in any manner. If any item is sent to the postmaster - be it intentional or automatic - it must be dismantled and cannot be added to a Guardian's inventory.</dd>
						<br>
						<dt class="listTitle">Expert+ PVE Activities</dt>
						<dd>When an activity presents a difficulty selection option to the player, only Expert or higher may be selected as the difficulty.</dd>
						<br>
						<dd>Endgame activities (Raids and Dungeons) are the only activities that can be completed on normal difficulty.</dd>
						<br>
						<dt class="listTitle">No Abandoning Activities</dt>
						<dd>Once an activity has been started, players are not allowed to leave or abandon the activity until they achieve "Mission Complete."</dd>
						<br>
						<dd>If an activity is ever soft locked due to an issue with the game or Destiny 2 servers, players may reload the activity from the start to attempt it again. No other activity can be started at this time.</dd>
						<br>
						<dd>If an activity is ever soft locked due to a player's own misjudgment (E.g. cannot stun/finish a champion or under-leveled), they are not allowed to leave.</dd>
						<br>
						<dt class="listTitle">Limited Characters</dt>
						<dd>At the start, only 1 Guardian may be created of a randomly selected class. After completing the following challenges, additional characters may be created:</dd>
						<br>
						<dd>- Complete the most recent Legendary Campaign.</dd>
						<dd>- Complete any raid.</dd>

				<button class="accordion">Why am I doing this?</button>
				<div class="panel">
						<p class="panelText">I like hard games, I like increasingly more difficult challenges, and I wanted to make the game I play the most as hard as I could.</p>
						<p class="panelText">Sure I could do lowmans like every other skilled Destiny 2 player, but this is way more unique than any other Destiny 2 accomplishment. And who's to say lowmans won't be part of this challenge in the future. ;)</p>

				<button class="accordion">How can I participate in this challenge?</button>
				<div class="panel">

						<dt class="listTitle">Livestreams</dt>
						<dd>100% of this challenge is streamed on my YouTube and Twitch channels, so make sure you are following me on those to know when I'm going live so you can watch along.</dd>
						<br>
						<dd>By watching the streams, you also build up points that can be redeemed for additional modifiers that make things even harder for me. Deleting and restricting items or characers are among redeemable options.</dd>
						<br>
						<dt class="listTitle">Discord</dt>
						<dd><a href="https://discord.gg/pYmVAG2jAw">Join The Bog Discord</a> for more community events and projects.</dd>
